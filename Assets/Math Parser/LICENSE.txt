ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON WORKSTATION

A workstation is a device, a remote device, or a virtual device, used by you,
your employees, or other entities to whom you have commissioned the tasks.
For example, the number of workstations may refer to the number of software
developers, engineers, architects, scientists, and other professionals who
use the PRODUCT on your behalf. The number of workstations is not the number

while the number of copies of your final product (delivered to your end-users)
is not limited.
